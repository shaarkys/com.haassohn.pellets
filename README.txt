Manage your Haas+Sohn pellet stove from Homey over your local network. The app shows live status such as current and target temperature, operating mode, eco or weekly program state, pellet consumption, and cleaning or maintenance indicators, and it can alert you to error codes.

Use Homey to switch the stove on or off, set the target temperature, toggle eco mode or the weekly program, and keep track of pellet levels. To get started, enter the stove's IP address or hostname and the PIN configured on the controller. Inspired by https://github.com/ioBroker/ioBroker.hass.
